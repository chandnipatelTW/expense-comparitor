i hate most readmes and most documention.
they almost always lie.
the code tells the truth.  always.
believe the code more than the documentation.


to use this application, you'll need to do the following:

open the file at: <root_project_directory>/src/main/java/org/spargonaut/Application.java
uncomment the line that says: application.run();
its usually found on line 25. ymmv.

download your bank statements as a csv file.
put them in the following directory:
<root project directory>/data/credit_card_files/

download your expense reports from expensify (use the default csv template).
put them in the following directory:
<root project directory>/data/unicode_expense_files
